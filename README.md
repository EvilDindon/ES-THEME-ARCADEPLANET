  # ** IMPORTANT **

This theme relies on clean artwork.
I recommand SCRAPING all your games using screenscraper with the following parametrs :

# IMAGE SOURCE : SCREENSHOT

# BOX SOURCE : BOX 2D

# LOGO SOURCE : WHEEL

These 3 parameters are mandatory. If you put other thing (mix images, etc.) the theme will not look as good as intended.
